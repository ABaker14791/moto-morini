        <h2>1937: The start of the adventure</h2>
        <p>
          After almost 15 years of collaboration with Mario Mazzetti and the MM,
          in September 1937 Alfonso Morini sets up on his own. He opens a small
          firm in via Malvasia in Bologna where in January 1938 he starts to
          produce three-wheelers with 350, 500 and 600 cc engine sizes. A choice
          dictated by the conditions of the period as motorcycle type
          three-wheelers enjoy reduced taxation, a driving license is not
          necessary and they cost a third of small trucks. Affordability and
          good performance begin to give the new company in Bologna notoriety.
          For the technical aspect Dante Lambertini, Gino Marchesini and Dolcino
          Veronesi are involved, who will become key figures in the post-war
          period when the company will concentrate on the motorcycle sector,
          abandoning three-wheelers.

        <h2>1946: The first motorbike</h2>
        <p>
          Notwithstanding the wartime bombardments which destroyed the factory,
          Alfonso Morini does not lose heart and he starts again from scratch.
          In the 2-stroke 125 engine he sees the perfect vehicle suitable for
          postwar needs. The first Moto Morini even appears in spring 1946, and
          due to time constraints it is inspired by the best 125 of the time,
          the DKW RT. Production starts in a new factory in via Ludovico Berti,
          always in Bologna. The 125 is the first lightweight engine to be
          produced in an Italy liberated from fascism and when it is presented
          to the trade fair in Milan it is defined as motorcycling’s “success of
          the year”.

          The tourist model is flanked by the sports version. Power increases
          from 4.5 HP to 5.7 HP, speed from 75 to 80 km/h. The first 125 models
          top their rivals for quality, reliability and comfort (even from its
          debut it is equipped with rear suspension). Production ends in 1954.
          With the two-stroke 125 starts the first race competitions and the
          first victories are achieved. Umberto Mascetti starts off his
          brilliant career with this small motorcycle which thrills for the
          first time, especially in 1948 when winning several races in the
          second tier Italian championship. The race version has 4 gears instead
          of 3 and arrives at 8/9 HP. Speed is around 120 km/h.

        <h2>1949</h2>
        <p>
          Realising the superiority of the 4-stroke engine, Alfonso Morini gives
          the green light to a new GP motorcycle, the chain-driven 125
          single-shaft . Compressed 9:1 and with a 28mm carburetor, it produces
          12 HP at 10.000 rpm. The motorbike weighs 80 kg. Besides several top
          tier national titles, this is the first Moto Morini to win a GP, in
          1951 at Monza with Emilio Mendogni, beating the MV and the Mondial
          bialbero bikes. At the end it is able to produce 16 HP.

        <p>
          The 175 Settebello debuts, the top of the range of the Bologna firm,
          much sought after also by those who want to compete in races,
          especially long distance. This model, developed with competition in
          mind, achieved its maximum level of development in 1962 with the 22 HP
          at 10.500 rpm “Aste Corte” version.

        <h2>1954</h2>
        <p>
          At the year of the year the fabulous 175 Settebello is created,
          destined for the Milano-Taranto and the Motogiro d’Italia races. A
          single-cylinder with single-shaft split distribution capable of 22 HP
          at 9.000 rpm. It has a very effective chassis – an open duplex cradle
          frame, top level hydraulic suspensions – and it proves to be a winner
          in both the classic long-distance races. Produced in around 15
          examples, it has also been developed as a 250 cc.

        <h2>1955</h2>
        <p>
          The increase in production requires a new plant and so Moto Morini
          moves to via Bergami 7, of course always in Bologna.
        </p>
      </section>
      <section>
        <h2>1957</h2>
        <p>
          Alfonso Morini decides that it is now the moment to take part with
          continuity in the world speed championship and the new project for a
          250 cc GP bike is developed by Nerio Biavati, the ex-right hand man of
          the technician Alfonso Drusiani in the corse Mondial department.
          Entrusted to Mendogni it will go on to win the Shell Cup in Imola in
          1959, but later it will not be able to compete with the MVs. The
          demise of the 2-stroke 125 causes Moto Morini to fill the gap in the
          range in the more commercial market. Rejecting the hypothesis of a
          reduced 175 single-cylinder, a new more modern and rational product is
          chosen, in such a way as to reduce the number of components and to so
          limit production costs. Hence the creation of the nippy 100 – an
          engine size still adequate at the time – which will serve as a base
          two years later for the birth of the Corsaro 125.

        <p>
          Another great rider whose name is linked to Moto Morini is Angelo
          Bergamonti (18 March 1939 – 4 April 1971). An admirer of test rides
          with which he shares great affinity: the passion and respect for the
          mechanics, research and riding style. Debuting in 1957 in the reserves
          category with a 175 Settebello, and after a pause of a few years also
          due to marriage, he restarts as a junior in 1964, always on a Morini
          175 which he prepares in the Gussola workshop. In 1966 he is a senior,
          racing with the Corsaro 125 and the glorious 250 bialbero ex-test bike
          which gives Moto Morini victory in the 1967 Italian championship.

        <h2>1965</h2>
        <p>
          Exports to the USA begin through the importer John Berti. New models
          are created with different specifications from those sold in Italy and
          they even change name: for example the Corsarino becomes the Pirate
          and Twister, the Corsaro, always depending on the version is called
          the Thunder Chief, Jaguar, and Hurricane.
        </p>
      </section>
      <section>
        <h2>1966</h2>
        <p>
          Even if the first true open road 125 was born in 1962, deriving from
          the road model from which it distinguishes itself by its few details,
          we need to wait until 1965 to see the first real Corsaro off road in
          action. From 1966 the victories start: in the 125 category Moto Morini
          wins the two-day Bologna and the Bergamo valleys events and the Road
          Race trophy. Moreover, Franco Dall’Ara conquers a gold medal in the
          international six-day event in Sweden, racing as a private competitor.
          Still in 1966, next to the 125 comes the 150 (142.6 cc), followed one
          year later by the 100 cc (98.1 cc) when all the motorcycles are
          equipped with a new closed duplex cradle frame with a vertical printed
          sheet metal tube, built by the specialist Ronzani, together with new
          suspensions and an engine with modified power supply and transmission.
          This Corsaro allows Dossena, Collina and Gritti to win the Italian
          championships in the 100, 125 and 175 categories to which are added 4
          gold medals in the six-days and 3 victories in the Bologna two-days
          event. During 1968 the engine is further developed. The larger engine
          size single-cylinder increases to 153.1 cc in order to have greater
          torque and power. Success continues both in Italy and abroad. The
          six-days race is held in San Pellegrino, 19 Moto Morini bikes are
          entered and 15 arrive at the finishing line winning 7 gold medals, 3
          silver and 3 bronze. Rottigni wins the Bologna two-days event and the
          National Championship in the 100 category, while Collina takes the 125
          class. In the winter of 1968-1969 the Ronzani frame is strengthened.
          The restyling includes its appearance with a different fuel tank
          (rapidly detachable), supplied with knee pads and a tool box panel,
          while the engine has a 5-speed gear change. Already in 1968 comes the
          refined Bonazzi & Gambetta fork including, and this is exclusive,
          breather cap valve vents. Among the 1969 results we recall the
          victories in the Italian Championship 100 category of Signorelli and
          Gritti in the 175. In 1970 Gritti again wins in the 175 and Oldrati in
          the 125. Moreover in the six-days in Spain the three Italian teams
          (one in the trophy and two in the vase) all race with Morini bikes,
          with updated engines, Ceriani forks and on 6 motorbikes the
          experimental Verlicchi frames. Of the 22 Corsaro entered, 19 finish
          the race with 16 gold medals, 2 silver and 1 bronze. These examples
          are the base of the new and final 1971 version which will, with the
          125, be put alongside the 165 (163.9 cc) substituting the 160.

        <h2>1975</h2>
        <p>
          At the beginning of the year the Corsaro is substituted by the 125 h
          with an engine which is by and large derived from the 3 1⁄2. It is the
          most modern of its contemporary 4 strokes and boasts some unique
          details, from its electronic ignition to six gears. Moreover it
          immediately enjoys the benefits of a 260 mm front break disc, the same
          as on the 3 1⁄2. Having 13.75 HP at 9.000 rpm it can reach speeds of
          125 km/h. The 125 goes out of production in 1985, leaving the KJ 125
          endurance bike with the task of carrying the Morini flag among
          motorbikes for sixteen year olds.

        <h2>1977</h2>
        <p>
          From 1975 Morini works on the new 500 road bike, presented in its
          definitive version at the 1977 Milan trade fair. The engine size
          increases to 478.5 cc (69×64 mm), power to 43HP at 7.500 rpm, and
          speed to 175 km/h. A year later, working only on its external
          appearance, the sports version is created. In 1981 the engines are
          supplied with a six-speed gear change. 1978 sees the debut of the
          excellent 250 two-cylinder (59×43,8 mm = 239.5 cc) with 25 HP at 9.000
          rpm and a speed of 140 km/h, which sells well, especially abroad.
          Below, the 1977 range which also includes the 18.5 HP single-cylinder
          250.
