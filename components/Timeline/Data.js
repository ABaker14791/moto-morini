    body: "After almost 15 years of collaboration with Mario Mazzetti and the MM, in September 1937 Alfonso Morini sets up on his own. He opens a small firm in via Malvasia in Bologna where in January 1938 he starts to produce three-wheelers with 350, 500 and 600 cc engine sizes. A choice dictated by the conditions of the period as motorcycle type three-wheelers enjoy reduced taxation, a driving license is not necessary and they cost a third of small trucks. Affordability and good performance begin to give the new company in Bologna notoriety. For the technical aspect Dante Lambertini, Gino Marchesini and Dolcino Veronesi are involved, who will become key figures in the post-war period when the company will concentrate on the motorcycle sector, abandoning three-wheelers.",

    body: "Notwithstanding the wartime bombardments which destroyed the factory, Alfonso Morini does not lose heart and he starts again from scratch. In the 2-stroke 125 engine he sees the perfect vehicle suitable for postwar needs. The first Moto Morini even appears in spring 1946, and due to time constraints it is inspired by the best 125 of the time, the DKW RT. Production starts in a new factory in via Ludovico Berti, always in Bologna. The 125 is the first lightweight engine to be produced in an Italy liberated from fascism and when it is presented to the trade fair in Milan it is defined as motorcycling’s “success of the year”.",

The first 125 models top their rivals for quality, reliability and comfort (even from its debut it is equipped with rear suspension). Production ends in 1954. With the two-stroke 125 starts the first race competitions and the first victories are achieved. Umberto Mascetti starts off his brilliant career with this small motorcycle which thrills for the first time, especially in 1948 when winning several races in the second tier Italian championship. The race version has 4 gears instead of 3 and arrives at 8/9 HP. Speed is around 120 km/h.",

Compressed 9:1 and with a 28mm carburetor, it produces 12 HP at 10.000 rpm. The motorbike weighs 80 kg. Besides several top tier national titles, this is the first Moto Morini to win a GP, in 1951 at Monza with Emilio Mendogni, beating the MV and the Mondial bialbero bikes. At the end it is able to produce 16 HP.",

It has a very effective chassis – an open duplex cradle frame, top level hydraulic suspensions – and it proves to be a winner in both the classic long-distance races.

Entrusted to Mendogni it will go on to win the Shell Cup in Imola in 1959, but later it will not be able to compete with the MVs. The demise of the 2-stroke 125 causes Moto Morini to fill the gap in the range in the more commercial market. Rejecting the hypothesis of a reduced 175 single-cylinder, a new more modern and rational product is chosen, in such a way as to reduce the number of components and to so limit production costs. Hence the creation of the nippy 100 – an engine size still adequate at the time – which will serve as a base two years later for the birth of the Corsaro 125.",

An admirer of test rides with which he shares great affinity: the passion and respect for the mechanics, research and riding style. Debuting in 1957 in the reserves category with a 175 Settebello, and after a pause of a few years also due to marriage, he restarts as a junior in 1964, always on a Morini 175 which he prepares in the Gussola workshop. In 1966 he is a senior, racing with the Corsaro 125 and the glorious 250 bialbero ex-test bike which gives Moto Morini victory in the 1967 Italian championship.",

    body: "Even if the first true open road 125 was born in 1962, deriving from the road model from which it distinguishes itself by its few details, we need to wait until 1965 to see the first real Corsaro off road in action. From 1966 the victories start: in the 125 category Moto Morini wins the two-day Bologna and the Bergamo valleys events and the Road Race trophy. Moreover, Franco Dall’Ara conquers a gold medal in the international six-day event in Sweden, racing as a private competitor. Still in 1966, next to the 125 comes the 150 (142.6 cc), followed one year later by the 100 cc (98.1 cc) when all the motorcycles are equipped with a new closed duplex cradle frame with a vertical printed sheet metal tube, built by the specialist Ronzani, together with new suspensions and an engine with modified power supply and transmission. This Corsaro allows Dossena, Collina and Gritti to win the Italian championships in the 100, 125 and 175 categories to which are added 4 gold medals in the six-days and 3 victories in the Bologna two-days event. During 1968 the engine is further developed. The larger engine size single-cylinder increases to 153.1 cc in order to have greater torque and power. Success continues both in Italy and abroad. The six-days race is held in San Pellegrino, 19 Moto Morini bikes are entered and 15 arrive at the finishing line winning 7 gold medals, 3 silver and 3 bronze. Rottigni wins the Bologna two-days event and the National Championship in the 100 category, while Collina takes the 125 class. In the winter of 1968-1969 the Ronzani frame is strengthened. The restyling includes its appearance with a different fuel tank (rapidly detachable), supplied with knee pads and a tool box panel, while the engine has a 5-speed gear change. Already in 1968 comes the refined Bonazzi & Gambetta fork including, and this is exclusive, breather cap valve vents. Among the 1969 results we recall the victories in the Italian Championship 100 category of Signorelli and Gritti in the 175. In 1970 Gritti again wins in the 175 and Oldrati in the 125. Moreover in the six-days in Spain the three Italian teams (one in the trophy and two in the vase) all race with Morini bikes, with updated engines, Ceriani forks and on 6 motorbikes the experimental Verlicchi frames. Of the 22 Corsaro entered, 19 finish the race with 16 gold medals, 2 silver and 1 bronze. These examples are the base of the new and final 1971 version which will, with the 125, be put alongside the 165 (163.9 cc) substituting the 160.",

It is the most modern of its contemporary 4 strokes and boasts some unique details, from its electronic ignition to six gears. Moreover it immediately enjoys the benefits of a 260 mm front break disc, the same as on the 3 1⁄2. Having 13.75 HP at 9.000 rpm it can reach speeds of 125 km/h. The 125 goes out of production in 1985, leaving the KJ 125 endurance bike with the task of carrying the Morini flag among motorbikes for sixteen year olds.",

In 1981 the engines are supplied with a six-speed gear change. 1978 sees the debut of the excellent 250 two-cylinder (59×43,8 mm = 239.5 cc) with 25 HP at 9.000 rpm and a speed of 140 km/h, which sells well, especially abroad.

With the arrival of the Cagiva Castiglioni brothers management “enthusiasm was still running high: we were preparing five prototypes of new models, among which an endurance bike, to show off our worth – recalls the designer Franco Lambertini – and also when they changed us into an engineering firm we were working with passion. Moreover the new 720 cc engine delivered 85 HP at 7.200 rpm and its production would have cost very little, in my opinion one billion lire less than a Ducati engine.
